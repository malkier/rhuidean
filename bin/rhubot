# This is the configuration. Edit from here down.
#
# HOW TO USE THIS FILE:
#
# This file is, strictly speaking, a Ruby script. We've provided
# methods that allow the configuration to be simple and human-readable.
# Anything that works in Ruby will technically work here, but we
# suggest sticking with the basics unless you know what you're doing.
#
# Unquoted strings are interpreted as Ruby statements. Numbers do not
# need to be encapsulated within quotes. If your string is basic alphanumeric
# you can use a :symbol (prefixing your string with a colon instead of
# encapsulting it with quotations) as it is less noisy.
#

# The actual configuration begins here
