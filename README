This repository contains a simple, quick IRC client library. If you have a
decent understanding of IRC and want to control most of the IRC events
yourself this is very easy and quick to pick up. The library handles all of
the socket code and sets up a simple event handling system for IRC events.

It's not very well documented yet, but I'm still working on it.

The code itself is documented. Run `rake rdoc` and check out the doc/ directory.
